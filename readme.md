##LuniDoc

This repo provides the extended API documentation for the Arduino Luni Device Driver library.  This repo is not required in order to run classes from the library, but hopefully the information contained will be helpful to the application developer.

More information about the overall architecture of Luni, its relationship with Firmata, a Javascript client library, and the released code are all available on Github from the wiki of account [finson-release](https://github.com/finson-release "https://github.com/finson-release") at:
