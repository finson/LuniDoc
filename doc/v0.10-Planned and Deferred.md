##v0.10 Planned and Deferred Changes in LuniLib

##Current Plan

* v0.8 ***done*** released June 6, 2016
* v0.9 ***done*** package Luni and FirmataWithDeviceFeature for release via Arduino library manager
* v0.9 ***done*** package LuniJS for release via npm
* v0.9 ***done*** released June 13, 2016
* v0.10 ***done*** DDSignal (Luni) and SignalAPI (LuniJS) - provide r/w for pins
* v0.10 spec - add discussion of the use of micro and milli interval timers, device action flags
* v0.10 move as much rodata to EEPROM as possible (not much, maybe?)
* v0.10 Review and refresh the reset function (memory, pin claims, ...)
* v0.10 Improve and document release process
* v0.11 Write and test Ping device driver, client API
* v0.12 Write and test Stepper device driver, client API


##Deferred Features and changes

* Debug info defined by LUN, retrieved with read (?)
* Put tools ram method in Meta
* SPI, OneWire Ports

##Related topics

* Firmata: Consider how to separate hardware pin modes from (1) the allocation of a pin to a particular feature and (2) noting the presence/absence of a feature.
    * Could features be identified by Sysex message code?  
    * `setPinAllocation(<sysex_query_code>, pins[])` returns false if no feature claims responsibility for the given command code
    * `setPinMode(pin, mode)` where mode is input, output, input_pullup
    * Where and what are the backwards compatibility impacts?  

* Client: Bring Java client up-to-date with asynchronous responses, Board-level management, client APIs

##Interesting, but not planned for implementation

* Logging facility as a FirmataFeature.
